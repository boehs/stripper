# Stripper ðŸ—¿

## A framework for LED strips

Generally, I've chosen interportability over performance here.

## Assumptions

- The animation will run at 30fps
    - If your code cannot run at 30fps, it is terible and should be fixed
- You can write rust
- You will be happy about writing rust
- The number of pixels is static

Edit: So it turns out my code is terrible and should be fixed
